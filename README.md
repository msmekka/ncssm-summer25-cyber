# 🛡️ NCSSM Cybersecurity Workshop Resources

Welcome to the official repository for the NCSSM Summer 2025 Cybersecurity Workshop!  
This repo hosts hands-on resources and datasets designed to teach key cybersecurity and data privacy concepts through practical exercises and guided machine learning projects.

## 📦 Contents

- 📓 **Secure_AI_Spam_Classifier_Colab_Template.ipynb**  
  Google Colab notebook featuring exercises on anonymization techniques and a simple machine learning spam classifier.

- 📨 **spam_clean.csv**  
  Pre-processed, anonymized version of the SMS Spam dataset (originally from Kaggle), safe for classroom use.

- 🧑‍💼 **Dummy_5000_Employee_Details.csv**  
  Synthetic dataset of 5,000 fictitious employee records for practicing data privacy and anonymization.

- 🏅 **NIST_RMF_Activity.ipynb**  
  Extra credit: Apply the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) to a synthetic dataset. Analyze governance risks and develop mitigation strategies using Python.
